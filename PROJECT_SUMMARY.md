## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Import errors when running app
**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Streamlit not found
**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install streamlit
```

**Solution:**
- Check that "Demo Mode" checkbox is enabled
- Verify `import time` is working (adds 2-second delay)

### Issue: Git push fails
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Create .gitignore first
# Remove .venv from tracking:
git rm -r --cached .venv
git commit -m "Remove venv"
git push
```

### Issue: Streamlit Cloud deployment fails
