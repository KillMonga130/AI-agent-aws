## 📝 Text Description Template

```
## Inspiration
Maritime operators worldwide face fragmented ocean data and complex forecasting requirements, leading to accidents, operational inefficiencies, and financial losses in the $100B+ maritime industry. We wanted to democratize access to intelligent ocean forecasting.

## What it does
Our Autonomous Ocean Forecasting Agent analyzes real-time ocean conditions (waves, currents, temperature) from Copernicus Marine Service and Open-Meteo APIs, identifies maritime safety risks using AI reasoning, and generates actionable alerts for vessel operators—all autonomously, 24/7.

## How we built it
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime** hosts the agent
- **Amazon Nova Pro** provides reasoning and decision-making
- **Strands Agents Framework** orchestrates multi-agent workflows
- **AWS Lambda** fetches and processes data from external APIs
- **Amazon S3** stores historical ocean data
- **Streamlit** provides user-friendly web interface

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating multiple data sources with different formats, implementing robust risk analysis thresholds, and ensuring autonomous operation without human intervention.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Built a fully autonomous agent that demonstrates real-world impact, uses advanced reasoning for maritime safety decisions, and makes ocean intelligence accessible to operators of all sizes.

## What we learned
How to build production-ready AI agents with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, implement multi-agent orchestration with Strands, and design autonomous systems that operate reliably without human oversight.

## What's next
Expand to more data sources (NOAA, local weather stations), add predictive ML models for long-term forecasting, implement vessel tracking integration, and partner with maritime authorities for pilot deployments.
